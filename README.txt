# Final Destination: Terminal

## About

Welcome to McKinley, population: About to be down another.

Final Destination: Terminal is a text-based adventure game inspired by the Final Destination movie franchise. You play as an investigative journalist who has narrowly survived a large-scale disaster in McKinley, a town plagued by tales of "Death's List."

Your goal is to uncover the truth behind these legends before the abandoned residence of William Bludworth, a key figure in the mystery, is demolished. You have a limited number of turns before dawn. Explore the decaying manor, find 3 key pieces of evidence, and try to escape Death's design.

**Warning:** This game contains themes of death, accidents, and suspense.

## Features

* **Explore a haunted manor:** Navigate multiple rooms filled with eerie descriptions and potential hazards.
* **Investigate the mystery:** Find clues and evidence to understand the nature of "Death's List."
* **Interactive gameplay:** Use text commands to interact with the environment, examine objects, and take items.
* **Increasing danger:** The more you interact with certain objects, the higher the chance of triggering a fatal accident.
* **Time limit:** You have a limited number of turns before the manor is demolished.
* **Multiple death scenarios:** Be careful! Death is always lurking, and seemingly innocuous actions can lead to grim consequences.
* **Escape mode:** Discover the truth and try to escape the manor before it's too late.
* **Inspired by Final Destination:** Experience the suspense and unexpected deaths reminiscent of the movie series.
